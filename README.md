#2048
This project is an implementation of the classic 2048 game written in x86 Assembly for Linux systems. The game runs on a 4x4 grid where players use the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys to move tiles up, left, down, or right, respectively. Tiles with the same value merge when they collide, doubling their value, with the goal of reaching the elusive 2048 tile. The program features a simple text-based interface, displaying the grid with aligned numbers and separators, and includes basic error handling for invalid inputs. A new tile (value 2) spawns randomly after each move, and the game ends when no further moves or merges are possible, displaying a "Game Over!" message. Designed for efficiency using low-level programming, this implementation showcases the power of Assembly in creating interactive applications.
