#2048
This project is an implementation of the classic 2048 game written in x86 Assembly for Linux systems. The game runs on a 4x4 grid where players use the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys to move tiles up, left, down, or right, respectively.  Designed for efficiency using low-level programming, this implementation showcases the power of Assembly in creating interactive applications.
